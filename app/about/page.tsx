                  Let me share a bit of my journey with you. Nails have been my passion since I was knee-high! After graduating from **Lakwerk Nailschool**, I dove straight into the world of nail artistry by joining their team. For a solid 1.5 years, I honed my skills and soaked up every bit of knowledge and experience I could.

                <ReactMarkdown>
                  Then came a change of scenery—I spent half a year at **Happy Toko**, where I continued to refine my craft and explore new techniques. But the call of independence and creativity beckoned, leading me to make the bold move to **Haarlem**, where I opened up my own salon right in the comfort of my home.
