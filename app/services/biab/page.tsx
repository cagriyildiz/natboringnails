                **BIAB, or Builder in a Bottle**, is a revolutionary gel product designed to add strength, flexibility,
                and a beautiful natural look to your nails. It&apos;s perfect for those looking to grow their natural nails,

                    I start with **meticulous nail preparation**, which includes gently filing your nails to your
                    desired shape, expert cuticle care, and carefully buffing the nail plate. This crucial step ensures
                    optimal adhesion for the BIAB and promotes overall nail health.

                    Next, a thin base layer of BIAB is applied and cured. Then, I carefully build a second layer,
                    creating the **perfect apex (the strongest part of the nail)** and precisely sculpting the gel to
                    achieve a smooth, natural-looking shape. Each layer is cured under a professional UV/LED light to
                    ensure maximum strength and durability.

                    After curing, I **refine the nails** with gentle filing to perfect the shape and smoothness. The
                    service is completed with a high-shine, chip-resistant top coat (cured for longevity) and a
                    nourishing cuticle oil application to hydrate and protect your nails and cuticles.
